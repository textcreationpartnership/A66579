            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1.

And if it were ſo perfect then, what may we judge it to be now, after the addition of ſo many choice and excellent Books, not then extant, wherein ſome things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were dark, are there made plain; and other things that before were unrevealed, are there ſet down?

And indeed it is not likely that God, who is perfect in all he doth,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.4.</note> and would have his Servants to give him perfect obedience, ſhould be unperfect in his Word, or deliver to them an imperfect Rule. Yet when I ſay the Scripture is a perfect Rule for all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Religion, I do not mean, it is an expreſs, particular Rule for every individual caſe or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance belonging thereunto; that is not to be imagined. Should God have drawn us ſuch a Rule,<note place="margin">John 21.25.</note> the World it ſelf would not have contain'd the Books that ſhould have been written. It is a particular Rule onely for Subſtantials, and a general one for Circumſtantials, which are ſo numerous, various, and mutable, that no other than a general one could be expected of them. Now as we muſt take care, that our Subſtantials be ſuch as fall under the particular directions of it; ſo we muſt take care that our Circumſtantials, how ſmall ſoever they may ſeem, be ſuch as fall

It ſpeaks much againſt ſuch things, but not one ſyllable, that I know of, for them.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60548:7"/>And when the time deſigned for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was expired, he did likewiſe himſelf abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them. And therefore no doubt if it had been his pleaſure, that the Church in the dayes of the New Teſtament, ſhould have worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him in the uſe of Ceremonies, he would have appointed them himſelf, as he did before, that ſo they might have come forth in his Name, and have had a Divine Stamp upon them as theformer had; and would never have left the appointing of them to Men, who he well knew would be unbridled, and unſatiable in introducing their own Inventions into his Worſhip.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60548:8"/>comely in one place, would have been ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fooliſh in another. But there is little ſtrength in this; for why might not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt have made other Ceremonies acceptable to all Places and People, as well as thoſe which he did appoint, or as well as other things which he commanded them to obſerve; ſuch as ſelf-abaſing, mortification, forgiving wrongs, loving enemies, and the like; which are as much, nay far more inconſiſtent with their cuſtomes and faſhions, than any of the Ceremonies under diſpute, are? The Laws of Chriſt have many things in them that ſuited no better, no, nor ſo well as the Ceremonies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on us would have done, had he injoyned them; yet did not that either cauſe him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the giving forth of his Laws, or his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the publiſhing of them. But ſuppoſe that Geſtures, Veſtures, &amp; ſome other of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies could not well have been pitched upon for all Nations, in regard of the diverſity of the Circumſtances before named, yet this is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon why none of them might; for there are ſome of them that have no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on thoſe Circumſtances. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Sign of the Croſs; what reaſon can any ſhew, wherefore if it had been the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Chriſt that his Church ſhould have uſed it, that he did not appoint it himſelf? I hope none will ſay, becauſe of the diverſity of places, perſons or the like; for why might not it have been as welcome to all places and perſons, as the Doctrine of Faith it ſelf, had it been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned? Wherein would the one have diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60548:8"/>more with the Cuſtomes and Faſhions of People than the other? Nothing at all; no, nor near ſo much. It is evident then, that Chriſt being ſilent concerning the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies contended for, when as he might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them (eſpecially that laſt mentioned) as well as other things, or as well as the Church did in after Ages, that it was not his pleaſure that they ſhould be made uſe of, at leaſt that they ſhould be made ſo neceſſary as they are. And if it were not his pleaſure that they ſhould be ſo, let thoſe who ſtand ſo much for them, and urge them under ſuch ſevere penalties, ſee how they will juſtifie it.</p>

Whether, though God hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted any Ceremonies for theſe dayes of the New Teſtament himſelf, ſave thoſe few above-mentioned, hath he yet impowred the Church to do it? It do's undoubtedly belong to God, to preſcribe things belonging to Religion; and he all along hath done it, either immediately by himſelf, or mediately by thoſe whom he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and enabled by ſpecial inſpirations, and abilities to do it. Now ſince Ceremonies are things belonging to Religion, and he hath no where appointed them himſelf, Whether can it be made to appear from any authentick and ſufficient evidence, that he hath impowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church, or any Perſon or Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to do it? Our Adverſaries in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Article, tell us that <hi>the Church hath Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> But 1.

Admit this clauſe in the Article were genuine, yet we would know how the Church came by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of decreeing Rites and Ceremonies. Hath God any where in Scripture committed ſuch a power to her?

               </note> Till they have ſhewed us ſomewhat in Scripture to that purpoſe (which we believe they will never do) they muſt give us leave to take it for granted, that ſhe hath no ſuch Power committed to her.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60548:9"/>ſo abſurd, that I hope, thoſe whom we now deal with, will not dare to own it, &amp; therefore I ſhal ſay no more of this. The place they moſt truſt in, and which upon all occaſions they retire to as their Sanctuary, is that of <hi>Paul,</hi>

And are not our Adverſaries and their Ceremonies in a deſperate condition, when this is all they have to ſhew out of the Word of God for them? Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are external Rites and Figures, which by reaſon of ſome Analogie or ſimilitude, are inſtituted to ſhadow forth ſome divine myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truths, which Nature never appointed them to do.

He takes himſelf to be as much diſobeyed and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured when he ſeeth men do more than he hath commanded, as when they do leſſe. Nay we do not find that the flames of his wrath have broken forth with greater fury upon any than Innovators, or thoſe that have brought into his Houſe and Worſhip ſuch things as he did not appoint.

God left not the choice of fire any more than other things to them, but appointed it himſelf; and they ſhould have kept to his appointment, but they declined from it, left it, and ſo ſinned.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60548:14"/>acting <hi>ſupra Statutum</hi> is all one with act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>contra Statutum.</hi> Therein God's not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring is equivalent to forbidding; and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than he commandeth, to do doing contrary to it. Then, as we have their ſin, ſo we have their puniſhment, and that is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; <hi>there went out a fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord.</hi> Though they were the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and men of renown, yet God was ſo provoked with this offence, that he ſlew them before him, and that both ſuddenly and dreadfully: <hi>Suddenly,</hi> for he gave them not ſo much as the leaſt time of repentance, but deſtroyed them immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even as they ſtood before the Aſtar. <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> for he did it by fire, the moſt furious and terrible of all the elements.

A further inſtance we have in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the dayes of the New Teſtament. When our Saviour had by his Death aboliſhed the Ceremonial Law, and appointed it to be laid aſide, and the <hi>Jews</hi> would notwithſtanding keep it up, God was ſo incenſed againſt them, that he takes that ſtately Temple, ſets it on a flame, and burns it to aſhes; thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his own Sons Prophecy,<note place="margin">

God hath appointed his Word for the Rule of our ſervice, and he will not have us turn either to the right hand or to the left, either to do more or to do leſs than it commands, but to keep to it without any deflection whatſoever.</p>

If therefore the Magiſtrate will anſwer the end of his power, which by all means he is to endeavour, he muſt ſee that whatever he commands or does, have a real and proper tendency in it to the good of thoſe over whom he ruleth. Now the commanding of unneceſſary things, not tending unto the the common good (for if it did they were not unneceſſary) and conſequently not anſwering the end of his power, he may not do it. 2. There are many things that God hath ſo

Nay Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi> ſaith, <hi>It may be granted, that offence and hinderance to edification doth ariſe from the Ceremonies.</hi> And who, ſetting out thoſe whom <hi>the God of this world</hi> hath been dealing with, are ſo blind as not to ſee it? To pretend it is offence taken and not given (as our Adverſaries do) is a ſhift too groſs to take place in a day of ſuch light. When they have proved that the Ceremonies are lawful, and that they do lawfully impoſe them, then they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60548:22"/>may with ſome ſhew of Reaſon make ſuch a pretence, but till they have done that, they ſhould forbear. But ſuppoſe it were offence taken, not given, yet would not that clear them, becauſe they are the occaſion of taking it. It is not only required that we do not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally</hi> or <hi>directly</hi> give offence to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but likewiſe that we do not ſo much as adminiſter an occaſion whereby they may take it, unleſs it be in the neceſſary diſcharge of our duty, and then indeed it is not culpable to us but to them. What do our Adverſaries think of the <hi>high Places, Gideons Ephod,</hi>

But notwithſtanding the caſe be thus plain, in ſtead of acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and laying down the Ceremonies, the inſtruments of it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the charge upon us, telling us, <hi>That by our ſtanding out against the Ceremonies, we diſobey and offend Authority, whom we ſhould by all means
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60548:23"/>labour to pleaſe.</hi> But this is of ſmall weight; For 1.

We muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that (as I intimated before) there is a double active ſcandal; there is ſuch a one whereby we occaſion our brothers ſin, and ſuch a one whereby we occaſion his diſpleaſure. Now if we have two wayes before us, one of which we muſt neceſſarily take, and the one will occaſion our brothers ſin, and the other his diſpleaſure, we muſt venture upon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as being a leſſer evil, rather than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; We muſt <hi>pleaſe him to his edification,</hi>

If we do not make uſe of them, we diſpleaſe Authority. In this ſtrait what muſt we do? Why of two evils we muſt take the leſs; and whether the occaſioning of the ſin of the one, or the diſpleaſure of the other be the greater ſin, let the indifferent judge. But 3. If Authority be offended at our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, it is evidently offence taken, and not given.

               </note> the <hi>Obligation of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law,</hi> to which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it reſtrained, but likewiſe in our freedom from the <hi>Inventions, Traditions,</hi> and <hi>Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of men. This <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers do agree in: but then it is queſtioned whether this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty do extend to <hi>Judgment</hi> only, or both to <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> The learned Author, whom I have before mentioned, will have it to be founded upon the freedom of Judgment, and not of Practice; that is, he will have it to conſiſt (as he himſelf explains it) <hi>in judging
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60548:24"/>thoſe things to be free which are ſo.</hi> But herein I conceive he is no ſounder than in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Hypotheſis to which he would have it ſerviceable. For, 1. our being free from any Commands whatſoever, doth not conſiſt in our judging or eſteeming our ſelves to be ſo, (that looks too like the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Faith) but in our being ſo indeed. But 2. admit he had ſaid that which I would think he intends, namely, that this Liberty conſiſts in a <hi>freedom of our Judgements,</hi> and in that only; ſo that though we are impoſed on as to the outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet whilſt that remains undiſturbed we may be ſaid to enjoy our whole Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yet could not we cloſe with him. For it is evident that Chriſtian Liberty doth not only conſiſt in the freedom of the Judgment, ſo as that we are not either obliged or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to <hi>aſſent</hi> to things indifferent as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but likewiſe in our freedom of <hi>practice,</hi> ſo that it is in our own power and choice to obſerve and uſe them or not. For, 1. if the Bondage of the ancient Church conſiſted not only in her being bound to <hi>aſſent</hi> to ſuch and ſuch Ordinances as good and neceſſary, but alſo in her being ſtrictly tyed to <hi>obſerve</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> them, then the Liberty Chriſt hath purchaſed us therefrom, doth conſiſt not only in our being diſobliged from ſuch <hi>aſſent</hi> to thoſe Ordinances, but alſo in our being freed from the <hi>obſervation</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of them; but the Bondage of the ancient Church conſiſted not only in her being bound to <hi>aſſent</hi> to ſuch and ſuch Ordinances as good and neceſſary,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60548:25"/>but alſo (nay much more) in her being ſtrictly tyed to <hi>obſerve</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> them; therefore the Liberty Chriſt hath purchaſed us therefrom, doth not conſiſt only in our being diſobliged from ſuch <hi>aſſent</hi> to thoſe Ordinances, but alſo in our being freed from the <hi>obſervation</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of them. The conſequence muſt needs be granted; for ſuch as is the extant of our Bondage, ſuch muſt needs be the extant of that Liberty whereby we are freed from that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. It is the Aſſumption then that can only be pretended to need proof; and yet who is ſo unacquainted with Scripture, as not to know that much, nay the greater part, of the ancient Churches bondage conſiſted in external <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> ſuch as Circumciſion, Oblations, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and the like? And of what force this Argument is as to the Jewiſh Ordinances, the like it is of as to any Humane Ordinances about indifferent things: for it is not to be imagined, that Chriſt ſhould purchaſe for us greater liberty from thoſe Ordinances that once were of Divine inſtitution, and in their ſeaſon ſo neceſſary and profitable, than from thoſe that never were inſtituted by him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are any way neceſſary or profitable. 2. That which the Holy Ghoſt even whilſt he is explaining and bounding of Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth diſoblige and diſcharge us from, that we are to look upon as matter of Liberty, but even whiles he is explaining and bounding of Chriſtian Liberty, he doth diſoblige and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us not only from <hi>aſſenting</hi> to indifferent things as neceſſary, but alſo our <hi>obſervance</hi> of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60548:25"/>them, and therefore we are to look not only upon our <hi>non-aſſenting</hi> to them as things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but alſo our <hi>obſervance</hi> of them, as matter of Liberty. The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; for ſo far as the Spirit makes us free,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36.</note> ſo far we are free indeed. And the <hi>Minor</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Decree of the Council of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

               <hi>It ſeemed good</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen, than theſe neceſſary things,—from which if you keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well.</hi> It belongs to the Holy Ghoſt to determine what things are neceſſary, and what are not; and as he was pleaſed to do it for the Churches of thoſe times in particular, ſo he hath done it for the Churches of all ſucceeding Ages in general, telling us, that if we obſerve thoſe <hi>neceſſary things</hi> we <hi>ſhall do well.</hi> And therefore as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, we are freed from them, and bound no further to <hi>obſerve</hi> them, then reaſons of brotherly love and peace in order to the furtherance of the Goſpel, do perſwade and move us. 3. That which the Apoſtles in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Chriſtian Liberty abſtained from themſelves, and moved the People to whom they preached and wrote, to do the like, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and condemning their actings otherwiſe as a breach of their Liberty, that we are to look upon as matter of Liberty; but they abſtained not only from <hi>aſſenting</hi> to indifferent things as neceſſary, but alſo from the outward <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them, and moved thoſe to whom they preached and wrote to do the like, cenſuring and condemning their acting otherwiſe as a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60548:26"/>breach of their Liberty; therefore we are to look not only upon our <hi>non-aſſenting</hi> to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things as neceſſary, but alſo on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>obſervation</hi> of them as matter of Liberty. The <hi>Major.</hi> is good; for as we muſt not think but that the Apoſtles underſtood their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſo neither muſt we think that they would abſtain from, or preſs others to abſtaine from any thing but what was matter of Liberty. And the <hi>Minor</hi> is clear from ſeveral places of Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12. Gal. 4.10 Col. 2.20.21.</note> which to prevent tediouſneſs I ſhall only ſet down in the Margent, leaving you to conſult them at your leiſure. 4. If Chriſtian liberty lye only in the <hi>judgement,</hi> then we may not draw it forth into outward <hi>practice;</hi> but we may draw it forth into outward <hi>practice,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it lies not only in the <hi>judgement.</hi> The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is no other than ſound; for we may not extend our Liberty beyond its prefixed bounds. The truth of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> appears from the practice of the Apoſtles, and the whole Chriſtian Church all along, and our own Church in particular, which doth not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a liberty of <hi>judgement,</hi> but alſo a liberty of <hi>practice,</hi> uſing ſome things, and declining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as ſhe thinks fit. 5. If Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſt only in freedom of <hi>Judgement,</hi> then though men urge upon us the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the unneceſſary, frivolous, idle Ceremonies that ever were uſed by Jewes, Heathens, Turks, Papiſts or any other People whatſoever, and upon our refuſal to cloſe with them, bring upon us, the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impriſon, torture, burn us, yet if in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60548:26"/>mean time they allow us the freedom of out <hi>Judgements,</hi> they cannot be ſaid to hinder us of our Chriſtian Liberty; but if men ſhould urge upon us ſuch a multitude of Ceremonies, and upon our refuſal to cloſe with them, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the forementioned ſeverity, though in the mean time they allow us the freedom of our <hi>Judgements,</hi> they might be ſaid to hinder us of our Chriſtian Liberty, therefore Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty doth not conſiſt only in freedom of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is no other than what doth fairly offer it ſelf, and therefore is not to be excepred againſt. And as for the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> I prove it thus. If the urging us to worſhip God in a more troubleſom, burthenſom way than he hath been pleaſed to appoint, may be ſaid to be an hindering us of our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: then to urge upon us the obſervation of ſuch a multitude of Ceremonies may be ſaid to be an hindring us of our chriſtian Liberty; but to urge us to worſhip God in a more troubleſom burdenſom way than he hath appointed, may be ſaid to be an hindring us of our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, threfore to urge us to worſhip God in the obſervation of ſuch a multitude of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, may be ſaid to be an hindring us of our Chriſtian Liberty. Here I ſee not what can be denied; and therefore I think I have made good what I undertook, namely, that Chriſtian Liberty doth not conſiſt only in freedom of <hi>Judgement,</hi> but alſo in the freedom of <hi>Practice.</hi> But this Author goes on, and ſaith, That what he aſſerts, namely, that Liberty doth lye in the freedom of <hi>Judgement,</hi> and not in the freedom of <hi>Practice,</hi> and ſo is conſiſtent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60548:27"/>of the exerciſe of it, appears both in the caſe of Scandal, and in the actions of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the <hi>Jewes</hi> in matters of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To this I anſwer briefly. There is a two-fold Liberty; either ſuch as is abſolute, ſo that it may be uſed at all times, and in all places; or ſuch as is limited and bounded, ſo that it is not to be uſed at all times, or in all places,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.9.</note> but only when it may be done to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It is not the former of theſe that in this place we pretend to, but the latter. For though Chriſt hath given us a Liberty in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, yet he hath ſo limited it that we may not uſe it, but when we may do it without being a <hi>ſtumbling block to them that are weak.</hi> Circumſtances do ſo vary and alter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature, that that may be lawful for us at one time and place, which is not at another. It is lawful for us to <hi>bow the knee,</hi> but yet to do it in the <hi>houſe of Rimmon,</hi> or at the paſſing by of the <hi>conſecrated Hoaſt,</hi> when we may harden Idolaters, is not lawful. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had a liberty in the uſe of indifferent things, yet when the good of their weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren called for it, they not only might, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ought, eſpecially in that juncture of things, to wave it. And therefore their complyance with the weak <hi>Jews</hi> was not matter of Liberty, but Duty and Neceſſity, inſomuch that they had ſinned if they had not done it. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this their liberty of <hi>practice</hi> was thus ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon ſpecial occaſions to reſtraints, it doth not follow that their Chriſtian Liberty did not at all conſiſt in <hi>practice,</hi> but that it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60548:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>to them in a limited ſence, to be uſed ſo, as it might become moſt ſerviceable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for the furtherance whereof it was given.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. Whether, though they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us the Liberty purchaſed by Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to us by his own Will and Teſtament, but will be tying our hands, and laying upon us <hi>burdens</hi> contrary to it; yet is it not our duty to defend and maintain it, by withſtanding them in their unjuſt commands and impoſitions? I call them unjuſt commands and impoſitions, becauſe they do command and impoſe ſuch things as ought to be left free, and at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of every one to uſe them or not uſe them, as he is more or leſs perſwaded of the lawfulneſs or neceſſity of them. Certainly if Chriſt hath beſtowed ſuch a Liberty upon us as a token of his tenderneſs and bounty, and for this end, that we ſhould improve it for him, and ſerve him with chearfulneſs in the uſe of it; then as they ought to allow it us, ſo we ought to maintain it. It is no leſs than tyranny and cruelty in them not to do the one; and it were no leſs than folly and unthankfulneſs in us not to do the other. As it was the work of Jeſus Chriſt to give it us, ſo it is our duty to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and improve it now it is given. When the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> urged <hi>waſhing of hands before meat</hi> on the Diſciples, and they for the maintainance of their juſt Liberty withſtood them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.3</note> our Saviour openly countenances them in it. Inſtead of falling on them and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for their diſobedience, he falls on the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and blames them for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60548:28"/>ſuch vain Traditions, to the ſubverting of his Fathers Commandments, and troubling of his Diſciples. But perhaps our Adverſaries will except and ſay, <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Commandments and impoſitions of private men, and of ſuch as are in Authority, and have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us, and may give Laws to us. The Scribes and Phariſees, though they were wiſe men, yet they were not men of Authority, and ſo had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do to impoſe ſuch a Ceremony either on the Diſciples or on any other, and therefore no marvel if the Diſciples withſtood them, and our Saviour countenanced them in it. Anſw.</hi> This excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion runs upon a miſtake, for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that both the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were men of Authority.

                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27 4.10.</note> We may with our Saviour, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bread and Water, take occaſion both to think and ſpeak of ſpiritual; yet we may not take either the one or the other, and ſet it up as a ſtanding remembrancer to us. We may from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60548:33"/>the beholding of a Surplice, take occaſion to think of the preſumption and boldneſs of men, that not contenting themſelves with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Chriſt and his perfect Inſtitutions, will be framing of ſuch needleſs, ſuperſtitious vanities; but yet if we ſhould take a Surplice and hang it up before us, that ſo it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually put us in mind thereof, we ſhould render our ſelves as ridiculous as thoſe who uſe them for another end. 3. We muſt alſo put a difference betwixt making a ſpiritual uſe of thoſe ſenſible matters that are before us, and bringing them into the houſe of God, and there allowing them ſtate in his Worſhip. We may from the be holding of a Lamb, take occaſion to think of him, who <hi>was led as a Lamb to the ſlaughter;</hi> but yet we may not bring a Lamb into the place of Worſhip to mind us of him; that were to put upon a ſilly beaſt the office of the Word and Sacraments, which were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that uſe. But to leave this, whiles our Adverſaries are labouring to maintain the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their ſignificant Ceremonies, I would by the way know one thing of them, and that is this, They ſay they teach no Doctrine but what is contained in Scripture, and yet withal ſay, that the ſign of the Croſs doth teach us not to be aſhamed of Chriſt crucified. Now let them either ſhew us where the Scripture ſaith, that the ſign of the Croſs doth thus teach us, or elſe confeſs that they teach ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine beſides what is contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60548:34"/>to add New parts to the Worſhip of God? That ſurely they may not do without guilt of higheſt preſumption. It doth, and ever did, and always will undoubtedly belong to God, and none but him, to inſtitute and preſcribe his own Worſhip, and every part of it. And therefore all ſuch as undertake to <hi>do it,</hi> how wiſe, holy, or great ſoever they may ſeem to be, do no leſs than invade his Royal Throne, and uſurp his Soveraign Power. What guilt then have our Adverſaries drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in inſtituting of the Ceremonies! For, have they not introduced them into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and made them parts of it? Are not remembrances and inſtructions concerning conſtancy, pureneſs, reverence, and ſuch like duties, really and properly religious Worſhip? And are not the Ceremonies ſuch things as theſe? Do they not allow them ſtate in their Worſhip? Have they not the ſame uſe and end that other parts of Worſhip have? Do they not urge them with the ſame rigor that they do hearing of the Word, Praying, Singing of Pſalms, and other ſubſtantial duties? Do they not count the pureſt, holyeſt, ſincereſt ſervice as imperfect, diſorderly, ſlovenly, and I know not what, without them? Is it not therefore evident that they make them parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderable parts too of Worſhip?<note place="margin">T <hi>3.</hi> de effect. ſac. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi> p. <hi>92.</hi>

Here you ſee the evidence is clear on all ſides: yet even in this our Adverſaries have ſomewhat to ſay for themſelves. And 1. They alledge, that if we muſt not make uſe of thoſe things that have been abuſed, we muſt make uſe of nothing; for there is not any thing in the world, how lawful, holy, or neceſſary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but it hath been one way or other abuſed. Not only Ceremonies, but alſo the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and all the Ordinances and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God have been abuſed: and therefore, according to this Doctrine, we muſt not make uſe of any of them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Papiſts defend themſelves againſt us, when we, diſputing againſt their Ceremonies, urge them, with the abuſe of them, among the Idolatrous Gentiles.<note place="margin">T. <hi>3.</hi> de Eff.

               <hi>If this kind of reaſoning</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) <hi>availed, we ought to aboliſh both Baptiſm and the Supper, for that they have been abuſed.</hi> And yet who ſeeth not the weakneſs of ſuch an anſwer? 2. Our Adverſaries may do well to remember, that by this defence they reflect upon their Mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who (as I have already ſhewed) thought the abuſe of ſome Ceremonies a ſufficient reaſon wherefore they ſhould be aboliſhed. 3. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and ſuch things as are of <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſtanding uſe:</hi> and the unprofitable devices of men, and ſuch things as are <hi>unneceſſary,</hi>

               </note> and yet our Writters think they cannot do it, nay ſome of their own think ſo too. 2. They do in this, as well as in the former, fly in the face of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for ſhe hath not onely aboliſhed many of the ſame individual Ceremonies, abuſed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but the ſame in kinde likewiſe; and not without reaſon: for the evil that befalls cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain individuals, does as it were diffuſe it ſelf all over, ſtain and diſgrace the whole ſpecies; inſomuch that for the evils of certain indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, the whole kinde is often laid aſide: as I might ſhew by many inſtances, which I ſhall not here trouble you with. Now ſuch is the purity of God, that he will not endure any thing in his Worſhip that hath ſo much as an evil report, or a bad name, or any affinity or relation to what is evil. 4. God forbids us (as I ſhall acquaint you further anon) to do after the manner of Idolaters; which plainly ſhews it is his will that we ſhould not only forbear the uſe of the ſame things in number, which they have abuſed, but the ſame things in kinde alſo. 5. Idolatry is a ſin, ſo diſhonourable and diſpleaſing to God, that we ought to ſhew our utmoſt deteſtation of it, which we cannot do ſo well by forbearing to uſe onely the ſame things in number that have been abuſed in it, as the whole kinde likewiſe. So long as we make uſe, either of the ſame things in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or in kind, that have been abuſed by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we ſeem to own and allow of what they do.

For, we muſt not think that Superſtition conſiſts only in the worſhipping of a ſtrange God, then none but groſs Idolaters were guilty of it; no, it conſiſts as well in the worſhipping of the true God after a ſtrange manner, that is, in the uſe of ſuch things as he hath not commanded. And therefore as the <hi>Athenians</hi> were guilty of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2 20 <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10.</note> in worſhipping <hi>they knew not what,</hi> ſo the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were guilty of it in their <hi>waſhing of hands;</hi> and ſome Chriſtians in the Apoſtles times in their abſtaining from <hi>meats,</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of dayes.</hi> And the Papiſts likewiſe are, and have long been gurlty of it, and that in a very high degree, in framing, impoſing, and uſing ſo many Articles, Doctrines, and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that have no foundation in the Word. When men content not themſelves with the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt, but to his Laws add new Laws, and to his Ordinances add new Ordinances, they do as really become guilty of it as if they worſhiped a ſtrange God. Herein <hi>Zanchius</hi> is expreſs. <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith

Whether upon the ſame grounds that they charge it upon us, may not the prophane Crew charge it upon all thoſe that will not drink, ſwear, game, and the like, as they do? 3. If they will have us, upon this account, to be guilty of it; how will they clear themſelves from it, when as they reject many Ceremonies of the Papiſts, as lawful and innocent in every reſpect as thoſe which they retain? Nay, 4. doth not this charge fall upon them again, and ſo lay them under a double ſuperſtition? For when they appoint ſuch poſitive Ordinances, as the Surplice in Divine-Service, the Croſs in Baptiſm, kneeling at the Supper; do not they for bid the contrary, as do not perform Divine-Service without the Surplice, do not Baptize without the Croſs, do not receive Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out kneeling; each of which Negatives not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is not only lawful, but a duty?

As they hold that Images, holy Books, and the ſacred Utenſils are to be adored; ſo they hold that the Ceremonies being holy things, and having relation unto God, are in like manner to be adored: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their daily practice in their oblations, kiſſings, bowings, and other teſtimonies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due repect which they give to them. But to ſay nothing of the reſt,<note place="margin">See Mr. Bradſh. Treatiſe of the Croſs, p. <hi>117.</hi>
               </note> what think you of the ſign of the Croſs? Do not they make a plain Idol of it? do they not how to it, and worſhip it? do they not aſcribe a divine efficacy to it? do they not ſay it expels Devils, heals Diſeaſes; and ſanctifies thoſe that are ſigned with it? do they not ſay it is powerful to throw down ſtrong holds, to convert ſinners, and bring them to ſalvation? If this be not to make it an Idol, what is? But as if this were not ſufficient, they go on, and tell us, <hi>That the ſame honour that belongs to Chriſt extended on the Croſs, belongs to the Croſs it ſelf; and the ſame honour that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Croſs, belongs to the Image of the Croſs, and the ſame honour that lelongs to the Image of the Croſs, belongs to the ſign of the Croſs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60548:45"/>made in a tranſient way, with the finger, upon the fore-head, breaſt, or elſewhere.</hi> For they do not place the merit or worth of it in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, but in the form or ſimilitude of it to Chriſt extended on the Croſs. And upon this ground, as they worſhip the one, ſo they do the other; &amp; as they make an Idol of the one, ſo they do of the other. But to this our Adverſaries ſay, <hi>grant the Papiſts aſcribe too much to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and make Idols of them, what's that to them, they make no Idols of them. Anſw.</hi> 1. Not only the Papiſts, but they likewiſe aſcribe too much to them. Do they not aſcribe to them the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of teaching divine and ſpiritual myſteries, which belong to none but God, and thoſe whom he authorizes to do it? Do they not uſe one to teach <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> another <hi>Purity,</hi> a third <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence?</hi> Do they not look upon them as the things that give beauty and life to the worſhip of God?

               </note> that <hi>the Sign of the Croſs is the inſtrument of Divine power and ſufficient to drive away Devils?</hi> And if we leave them, and go to ſuch of the common People as they have inſtructed and proſelyted to their way, do not ſome of them place as much holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neceſſity, and efficacy in them, as they do in the very Ordinances of God? Do they not make as much account of the Croſs, as they do of Baptiſm it ſelf? Do they not ſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it as conſtantly morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they ſay their prayers, accounting it a ſhield and defence to them againſt evil ſpirits? I ſpeak not this upon conjecture or hear-ſay, but from the mouths of ſome of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60548:46"/>who in diſcourſe have profeſſed it to me, and laboured to juſtifie it. But 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Papiſts only, aſcribe too much to the Ceremonies, yet that is ſufficient to render them unfit to come into the houſe of God, or have ſtate in his Worſhip;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</note> for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> It is not ſo material who it is that makes them Idols, as whether they are made Idols yea or no. Chooſe who they are that make them ſuch, they do, by being ſo made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unfit for Religious uſe. As for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that thoſe uſed amongſt us, are not the ſame individual Ceremonies that have been made Idols by the Papiſts, I have in part an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it already, and here add; 1. When our Adverſaries would convince us of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Ceremonies, they preſently ſend us to the Fathers, telling us that they uſed the ſame that we do; not the ſame in Number, but in Kind. Now if we ſhould take the ſame courſe with them that they do with us, and ſay that thoſe uſed by the Fathers, were not the ſame in Number with ours, but in Kind only, and that therefore their practiſe is not at all of force to us, would they not laugh us to ſcorn? And if we may argue from the uſe of ſome, to the uſe of others of the ſame kind, why may we not argue from the abuſe of ſome to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of others of the ſame kind? The Church of <hi>England</hi> heretofore thought we might, and therefore (as I told you even now) renders this as the weightieſt reaſon of the aboliſhing of certain of the Ceremonies, that they had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60548:46"/>been ſo much abuſed. 2. The Papiſts, have not only defiled the Ceremonies, as to ſome individuals of them, but likewiſe as to the whole kind, and that by a general conſecration.<note place="margin">Decret. part <hi>3.</hi> diſt. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>

Therefore to recal theſe ſtinking Garments, and other rubbiſh of the Popiſh Church, into the Church of Chriſt at this time, what is it but to give the Papiſts an occaſion, and the beſt that may be, to confirm &amp; harden themſelves and theirs in their Superſtitions, and alſo to help them in this buſineſs?</hi> Thus he. And it is well known that our uſing of their Rites and Cuſtoms doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with Arguments againſt us,<note place="margin">See Mr. Parker of the Croſs part <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> ſect. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>135.</hi>
               </note> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with ſomewhat to ſay in their own defence. They do not onely argue for their <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> from our <hi>Service-Book;</hi> and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they aſcribe to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> from our <hi>private Baptiſm;</hi> and their <hi>Abſolution, Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> from our <hi>Abſolution</hi> of the Sick, preſcribed in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Service-Book;</hi> but they likewiſe argue for their <hi>Croſs</hi> from <hi>ours;</hi> and for other Rites uſed by them, from thoſe uſed amongſt us. And thus the Fathers of our Church, who yet would be looked upon as the onely malls of Papiſts, inſtead of refuting the Arguments they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, help them to new ones; and inſtead of convincing them of their errors and evil ways, and reducing them from them, encourage and ſettle them in them.

Whether this their zealous retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ceremonies of the Papiſts, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with them therein, be not an argument that they have a ſecret deſign, when the wind ſtands right, to return to them again? If they have not ſome purpoſe that way, what's the reaſon that notwithſtanding all the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and intreaties of their Brethren, to lay the Ceremonies aſide, and all the unhappy conteſts they have occaſion'd amongſt us, they will not be got to do it, but chooſe to hazard Religion, Peace, Laws, Liberties and all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they wil part with them? What doth this hold forth, but that they uſe them in a <hi>Sacramental ſenſe</hi> indeed, that is, to ſignifie to the Papiſts that they have a ſecret reſpect for them; and that as they came from them, ſo they have a purpoſe to return to them? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no, I will not poſitively affirm, but it is manifeſt the Papiſts hope it is ſo, and we fear, if opportunity ſerve, it will prove ſo. If they would have us to lay aſide our jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, let them lay aſide the Ceremonies that do occaſion them. It hath been uſual that when any Nation or People have ſet up ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whether good or bad, they have alſo ſet up the Ceremonies of that Religion. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell to the worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> they

And ſo, on the other hand, it hath been uſual that when any Nation or People have thrown out ſuch a Religion, they have with it thrown out the Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> threw aſide the worſhip of <hi>Baal</hi> and the <hi>Calves,</hi> they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bowed to the former, nor kiſſed the latter; but as they deſpiſed them, ſo they did their Ceremonies. And when the <hi>Heathens</hi> forſook their Idols, and turned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they alſo forſook their Ceremonies, refuſing (as I have before ſhew'd) to have any thing common with them, or thoſe that worſhiped them. So when the Churches beyond the Seas caſt off Popery, they likewiſe caſt off the Ceremonies belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, not ſuffering ſo much as a dram thereof to remain.

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 43. Whether is it not probable (all things conſidered) that they retain the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies on purpoſe to ſerve them as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the promoting of Popery? Whether
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60548:59"/>is it not to be feared that they retain them to keep up the memory of it for the preſent, and to ſerve them as Engines to help them to wind it in amongſt us when a fit opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf? They know very well that the Ceremonies of <hi>Rome</hi> may be of great uſe to them to prepare the people for the Doctrine of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that if ever they can get Popery in amongſt us, it will be no ſmall advantage to them to tell the people, that the Ceremonies and Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> being like the Harlots attire and ſongs, both of the ſame ſtamp, they ought to go together; and that therefore as they have hitherto uſed the former, ſo it is fit they ſhould now cloſe with the latter. As for the peoples fleeing to diſtinctions, and telling them that though they uſed the Ceremonies of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet they uſed them not in that ſenſe that they do, not one in a thouſand (as they themſelves know and confeſs) is able to do it; and if they could,<note place="margin">See Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Eccl.

               </note> yet how ſoon can they take them off it? How eaſily can they tell them, that as the Popiſh Ceremonies are Images, ſo were theirs; as the Papiſts make their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies neceſſary, ſo did they theirs: as they aſcribe efficacy to their Ceremonies, ſo did they to theirs. With theſe and ſuch like Anſwers how eaſily will they take the ignorant people off what they will have to alledge in their own behalf? And what a ſnare then will the people find themſelves in? what a temptation then will they lie under, to ſubmit to whatever they will urge upon them? Now this our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries know; and therefore, I ſay, ſince they urge
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60548:60"/>the Ceremonies with ſo much zeal, that they will not be got upon any terms to lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but will part with Peace, the preaching of the Word, Religion, and all, rather than let them go; is it not likely in the judgment of any indifferent perſons, that they intend them as Engins to draw in the body of Popery, when an opportunity for ſuch a work offers it ſelf?

If the Ceremonies are ſuch Innocent, Decent, Edifying things, as our Adverſaries pretend they are, how comes it to paſs, that Atheiſts, Papiſts, Blaſphemers, Drunkards, Whoremaſters, and the whole rabble of Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Profane Perſons are ſo much for them? If they are what they ſhould be, how comes it to paſs, that the Worſt of Men are to in love with them, ſo zealous in obſerving them. ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60548:62"/>violent in urging and preſſing them? How comes it to paſs that they are moſt in requeſt where Chriſt is leaſt taught, and leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt where he is moſt taught?<note place="margin">Cenſur. Lit. Angl c. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>458</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bucer</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long ago, <hi>that People where the Goſpel was painfully preached cared not for them, but in places where it was unknown there they reverenced them.</hi> It is pretended that they teach the People Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Truths, and Duties; but if it be ſo, <hi>how happeneth it</hi> (as Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſaith in the caſe of Images) <hi>that where there is greateſt ſtore of ſuch Schoolmaſters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Repl. art. <hi>14.</hi> div. <hi>10</hi> p. <hi>510.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the People are ever moſt ignorant?</hi> Nay, how happeneth it, that People upon their Converſion care ſo little for them; nay, do thereupon take up ſuch diſlike and contempt of them? How happeneth it that their very hearts do riſe againſt them, and that of their own accord without any perſwaſions to it? If they are ſuch convenient uſeful things, as they are ſaid to be, how happens it that the Worſer ſort of men are ſo fond of them, and the Better ſo much againſt them? I confeſs its poſſible that a wicked man may be in the right, when a good man is in the wrong; but yet I ſhould think it no leſs than a wonder, if the profane crew, that <hi>are Children of wrath, eſtranged from God,</hi> and that do not ſo much <hi>as deſire the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his wayes,</hi> ſhould ſucceſſively from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation, hit upon the Truth: and that the moſt gratious holy men, that <hi>are enlightned by the Spirit of God,</hi> are under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being <hi>led into all Truth</hi> thereby, and that ſpend their days in reading the Scriptures, Praying, holding Communion with God,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60548:62"/>ſhould ſucceſſively, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, lye in darkneſs and error. Though all men are fallible, and therefore to be followed with ſuſpition and caution, yet its ſure far more likely that thoſe who <hi>fear God,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>have his ſecrets with them,</hi> ſhould poſſeſs the Truth, than that a company of carnal, ſenſual diſſolute ones (for ſuch are the generality of thoſe that ſtand for the Ceremonies) ſhould do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 46. If the Ceremonies are what they are ſaid to be, how comes it to paſs that God doth not ſet his ſeal to them, own them and bleſs them? How comes it to paſs that thoſe Miniſters who are the moſt zealous defenders, urgers, and obſervers of them, are ſo inſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Miniſtry? How comes it to paſs that they fall ſo far ſhort of others in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grace and holineſs in the hearts and lives of their People? I could mention two or three old Non-conformiſts, of whom if I ſhould ſay that they have brought more ſouls to Chriſt and Heaven, and done more to the demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satans Kingdom and Intereſt, than all the Biſhops, Deans, Prebends and Canons in <hi>England,</hi> I believe the People would ſecond me. Nay, (to drive this inquiry yet a little further) if the Ceremonies are what they ſhould be, how comes it to paſs, that ſuch as for a ſeaſon ſtand out, and afterwards Conform to them, do ſo far fall ſhort, both in Doctrine and Manners, of what they were before? It is notoriouſly known that ſome who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were againſt them, and have ſince fallen
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60548:63"/>in with them, are become as much unlike in Prayer, Preaching, Conference, Life, to what they were before, as the Tree in Winter to what it is in Summer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 47. Whether do not you think that many of thoſe who Conform, cloſe with the Ceremonies, rather to avoid Sufferings and gain Preferment, than out of any real liking they have of them? <hi>Sleidan</hi> tells of <hi>Iſlebius</hi> and <hi>Sidonius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Com. l. <hi>21.</hi> p. <hi>376.</hi> Catal. t. <hi>13</hi> p. <hi>696</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that they defended the Popiſh Oyl and Chriſm, that they might go away more unctious.</hi> And <hi>Schluſſelburg</hi> ſaith the like of <hi>George Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> the Schoolman. And we have good reaſon to think that many amongſt us make uſe of the Ceremonies rather that they may have their Liberty, and gain <hi>unctious Places,</hi> than out of any good grounds that they have for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them. And were the Scales turned, and Preferment layd in the other end, there were little doubt to be made, but they would be as ready to profeſs their diſlike and diſſent, as they have been to declare their aſſent and conſent. Sure I am that ſome of them, before <hi>Balaks</hi> Engine came to be uſed upon them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 22.17.</note> ſpake as contemptibly of them, as thoſe do who ſuffer for refuſing them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 48. Whether, ſince the Ceremonies are ſuch things as in the foregoing particulars I have ſhewed they are, would it not be a very great ſin in us, if out of deſire of Liberty, or upon any other account whatſoever, we ſhould go as many do, and declare our <hi>unfained aſſent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60548:63"/>and conſent</hi> to them, and being reſtored to our Miniſtry, ſhould uſe them in the diſcharge of it? Certainly if they are chargable with thoſe things I have alledged, and in part proved againſt them, we ſhould very greatly offend if we ſhould do it. The People ſtill cry out to us to Conform, and not by our ſilence hinder them of the benefit of our pains; but alas, they are in this like thoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7</note>

Things are got to ſuch a paſs, that we cannot have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to preach unleſs we cloſe with <hi>them,</hi> and we cannot cloſe with <hi>them,</hi> unleſs we leave the Word, which is the meaſure of truth and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, good and evil. And may thoſe that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and have been imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in teaching the authority of the Word, the neceſſity of keeping to it, and the danger of departing from it, go and leave it themſelves?

               </note> But to this an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Adiaphoriſt Objects; 1. <hi>That the Apoſtles ly direction of the holy Ghoſt, and upon reaſons of common and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60548:64"/>perpetual equity, did practiſe themſelves, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed others to practiſe, yea adviſed and injoyned (as matters good and neceſſary to be done) Ceremonies as inconvenient and evil in many main and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial reſpects, as the Ceremonies injoyned and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our Church are ſuppoſed to be. From whence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it follows, that to ſuffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, for refuſing to conform to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our Church, is contrary to the Doctrine and Practice of the Apoſtles. Anſw.</hi> 1. we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Ceremonies as are of Divine Inſtitution,<note place="margin">Vide Martyr. ep. amico cuid. in Angl. p. <hi>1125.</hi>
               </note> and ſuch as are only of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. As for the Ceremonies the Apoſtles uſed, they were ſuch as proceeded originally from God, and were appointed by him; but ours are of no ſuch extraction, they were fetch'd from the very den of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with whom he hath forbidden us to hold Communion. Now though it be true, that Gods own inſtitutions, when they are kept up longer, or converted to another uſe then they were at firſt deſigned for, ceaſe to be his Inſtitutions, and become the Inſtitutions of men; yet there is far more reſpect belonging unto them than there is <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> to any inſtitutions of men whatſoever, and that in regard of the divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their extraction. And therefore though the Apoſtles ſhewed ſo much reſpect to the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it is not to be thought that they would have done the like to others. Suppoſe ſome in their times had brought in ſome of the Ceremonies of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> and had urged them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and others, whether do you think they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60548:64"/>would have ſhewed the like reſpect to them, they did to thoſe of the <hi>Jews?</hi> It is not likely they would. If they would not comply with the <hi>Scriles</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the uſe of their Ceremonies (as I have ſhewed they would not) much leſs would they have complied with <hi>Samaritans</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> in the uſe of theirs. And if they would not have uſed the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Samaritans</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> much leſs would they have uſed the Ceremonies, of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (ſuch as ours are) had he exiſted in their dayes. 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as God hath own'd, and bleſſed, and made eminently uſeful in his Church; and ſuch as he hath never own'd, nor bleſſed, but hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born witneſs againſt and curſed, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the endeavours of ſuch as have been the greateſt defenders of them ineffectual. Now for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, as God did at the firſt inſtitute them, ſo he was pleaſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all along, until the time when they were to be laid aſide, to own them, and make them uſeful in his Church; but as for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Antichriſt, he hath been ſo far from owning them, or making them uſeful, that he hath followed them with remarkable ſymptoms of his diſpleaſure. And therefore though the Apoſtles, in order to their more decent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable burial, might for a ſeaſon uſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet it doth not therefore follow that they would have uſed the latter, or that we may do it. 3. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as have been abuſed by Idolaters, and by them made Idols, and ſuch as have not.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60548:65"/>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies though they were abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet they were never abuſed that way; but ours have been, and that in a high degree, as I have before ſhewed. 4. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt what is done only for two or three times, in a ſpecial exigence, and what is not. As for what the Apoſtles did, they did it in an extraordinary juncture of things, betwixt the taking down of an old Adminiſtration, and the ſetting up of a new one, before they had throughly publiſhed the Goſpel, or inſtructed the People in the Doctrine of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. What we do is in no ſuch juncture, but in a time when the Goſpel hath been preached all the World over, and the Church hath been fully inſtructed in the Liberty belonging to her; and that upon ſuch grounds as render them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at all times and in all places.<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>19.</hi>

               <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the obſervation of the Jewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at that time was to be approved; but that time being over, it was to be deteſted.</hi> 5. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Ceremonies as are uſed in a myſtical ſignificant manner, and ſuch as are not. Though the Apoſtles uſed the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Ceremonies, yet it doth not appear that they uſed them in any myſtical way, but only as circumſtances of order and policy, ſerving to unite the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But ours are to be uſed as teachers of ſpiritual My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and in that ſence we muſt either allow of them, or elſe we cannot declare our unfained aſſent and conſent to the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> neither approve our ſelves in the uſe of them, obedient Sons to the Church. 6. We muſt diſtinguiſh
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60548:65"/>betwixt ſuch Ceremonies as tend to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Scandals, and Separations, and ſuch as tend to the begetting of them. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies ſerved to unite the affections of divided brethren, but ours (as the experience of many years hath fully evinced) ſerve to divide the affections of united brethren; and therefore being of the number of thoſe things that God hath declared a <hi>peculiar hatred</hi> againſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.19.</note> we ſhould be ſo far from bringing them into the Houſe of God, and uſing them there in his Worſhip, that we ſhould caſt them out from us with no leſs than deteſtation and abhorrency. Indeed the Author I now deal with,<note place="margin">Caſſand. Ang p. <hi>68</hi>
               </note> reflects the charge on us, and ſaith, that <hi>Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the occaſion of Diſcord,</hi> and I confeſs it is; but yet no otherwiſe than <hi>Naboths</hi> keeping his Vineyard was the occaſion of his ſtoning;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.3.</note> or the Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their Impriſonment.<note place="margin">

But 2. He goes on,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 24.</note> and tells us <hi>that when two works or duties commanded of God do meet in one practiſe, ſo as we cannot do them both, but one of them muſt of neceſſity be done, the other muſt of neceſſity be left undone, in this caſe the work or duty of greater reaſon muſt be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that of leſſer reaſon muſt be omitted, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60548:66"/>it is a ſin to neglect the greater to perform the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer;</hi> out of which ground he aſſumes, <hi>That the the Doctrine and Practice of ſuffering Deprivation for refu ſing to Conform, doth cauſe men to neglect greater duties to perform the leſſer.</hi> The former he proves by ſeveral inſtances, as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſacrificing on the Sabbath, <hi>Davids</hi> eating of the ſhew-bread, the <hi>Diſciples</hi> plucking the ears of corn, and ſeveral other inſtances of the ſame nature. To all which I ſhall anſwer briefly; And 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch things as are evil accidentally, that is, meerly becauſe they are forbidden, and ſuch as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſimply and in their own nature. Now thoſe things which theſe Servants of God did in caſes of ſpecial neceſſity, were not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and in their own nature evil, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were forbidden. Neither were they for bidden abſolutely, but only ſo far as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of them might conſiſt with the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater evil. But the caſe is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with us; for in order to the gaining of our Liberty, we muſt not only do thoſe things which are evil meetly becauſe they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but becauſe they are ſo likewiſe in their own nature; as the declaring <hi>our unfeigned aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent</hi> to unwarrantable Obſervations, fabulous Stories, unſound Doctrine, as alſo the ſcandalizing our Brethren, faſhioning our ſelves to Idolaters, honouring of Images and Idols, with many other things which would have been evil though God had never by any poſitive Law forbidden them. 2. We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch neceſſity, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60548:66"/>either by his poſitive Command or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Providence layes upon us, and ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive and unreaſonable men bring us under. The Inſtances alleaged were of Gods making, and therefore nothing at all to us who are in the hands of men, that forbid us that liberty, that he hath not only allowed us to uſe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to maintain. Now though God who hath power over his own Law, be pleaſed to diſpenſe with our non-performance of thoſe works and duties which he himſelf, either by his poſitive Command, or ſpecial Providence doth diſoblige us from, yet we muſt not think that he will in like manner diſpenſe with our omiſſion of thoſe works and duties, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men out of their enmity to him, and his truth, do forbid us to perform, and we out of timerouſneſs or worldlineſs do thereupon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And therefore though the <hi>Prieſts, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the <hi>Diſciples</hi> and others, did upon urgent neceſſity laid upon them by God himſelf, act contrary to ſome poſitive Laws, yet we muſt not think that they would have done it upon the bare command of men, how great ſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch neceſſity. This we may gather from the example of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8.</note> who would rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon the offending of the <hi>King</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring his diſpleaſure, than he would eat of his polluted <hi>meat;</hi> and from the example of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Mace.</hi> 7.2.</note> who would rather endure the greateſt torments, than taſte of <hi>Swines fleſh.</hi> Though the <hi>Kings meat</hi> and <hi>Swines fleſh</hi> were both of them contrary to the Ceremonial Law, yet no doubt if Providence had brought them
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60548:67"/>into ſuch a ſtrait as <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were in, they would have eaten as well as they; but being there was no neceſſity for it, ſave what the command of man made, they would not do it. So as to our caſe; though we ſhould ſuppoſe the things required of us, to be ſuch as that in a caſe of ſpecial neceſſity layd upon us by God, we might do them, yet doth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that we may do them out of ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, meerly upon the command of man; Nay, it appears by what I have here alleaged, that in ſuch a caſe only, we might not do them.

Its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likely that they, taking all ſo contained and preſcribed, to be ſound and neceſſary, look that we ſhould do ſo too, and declare as much in publick. And therefore if we will declare, we muſt declare in that ſenſe, otherwiſe we equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and deceive their expectations. 2.

Did it unite the differing parties? No; but ſet them further at diſtance than they were before. And if we deſcend to later times, hath this courſe wrought any better therein? No; but hath yeelded the ſame effect
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60548:70"/>it did before. For inſtance, when <hi>Rochezana</hi> with ſome other of the more luke-warm ſort of the <hi>Huſſites,</hi> ſubmitted upon mutual abatements, to an accommodation with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> what was the event of it? why, not long after their Adverſaries reduced them to their former ſtate, and made them ſubject to the tyranny of the <hi>Pope</hi> as before. And what became of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Interim?</hi> Did it heal the breach betwixt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts?</hi> No, but made it wider than ever; and which was worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got differences amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The like may be ſaid of divers other compoſitions betwixt both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> which have proved ineffectual as to the procuring of the unity and peace aimed at and intended by them. In like manner when thoſe good men that carried on the Reformation in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th dayes, out of a charitable zeal, let many things alone that ſhould have been removed, hoping thereby to win the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;</hi>

               </note> this their complyance (as ſome learned men have noted) proved ſo far from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their expectations, that it did not only harden the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their way, and prevent their coming in to us, but likewiſe drew many of ours back to them.

Their oppoſites were ſo far from accepting their condeſcention, and anſwering it with the like on their part, that they loaded ſome of them, who laboured moſt in the work, with moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumnies and reproaches. When men are once ſet upon ſuperſtition, they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to let it go. Though when they are in a ſtrait they may ſomewhat recede and give place (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he was under Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) yet when their opportunity comes, they are ſure to return to their former height. And ſuch is the inſinuating, bewitching nature of Superſtition, that when men have entertained it they know not where to reſt, but commonly go from ſtep to ſtep till they have overthrown the pure Worſhip of God, and made themſelves the perfect Vaſſals of Satan. Beſides, it is to be obſerved, that as God hath no where allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Servants to uſe diſhonourable unworthy complyances,<note place="margin">Cont.

               </note> ſo (as <hi>Sadeel</hi> notes) he doth not bleſs them. And therefore though we ſhould go againſt our Conſciences, and fall in with the men who are over us in the Church, and do what they at preſent require, yet it is ſcarcely to be imagined that they would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>And thus I have given you the <hi>Queries</hi> I promiſed you, and therein what I thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſay at this time touching the ſo much
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60548:71"/>controverted Ceremonies. I have indeed much exceeded my intended bounds, but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I had to ſpeak of were ſo many, and the exceptions to which they (with other of the plaineſt truths, in this critical and cavilling age) lye open to, ſo various, that I could not, if I would obtain the end of my undertaking, well confine my ſelf to a narrower compaſs. What advantage the reaſons I have inſiſted on might have received from farther amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, illuſtrations, teſtimonies, I preſume I need not to tell you. All the favour I crave from you is, that you would allow them a juſt and even Ballance, and then account of them but according to the weight and worth that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall find in them. If the Ceremonies ſtand chargable neither with all, nor any of thoſe things I have brought in againſt them, then you are to acquit our Adverſaries, who defend and impoſe them and condemn us who refuſe and withſtand them; but if otherwiſe, then you are to condemn them, and acquit us. And yet you are to remember, that you are not to meaſure our ſtanding out, as to the matter of Conformity only by the Ceremonies, ſo as to judge of our carriage as to that particular as you find them; for notwithſtanding the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold evils we charge them with; yet there are other things urged upon us that we ſtick at, no leſs than we do at them; ſo that though they were either proved lawful, or the Impoſition of them waved, yet we could not, for very weighty reaſons, come in and do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from us, in order to our Liberty.
